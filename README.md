### Assignment:

Make a table using the `donations_over_5K.json`. The data contains all campaign donations over $5,000 filed with the Missouri Ethics Commission. 

* Make a table using the data in the json file using:
	* A for loop
	* HTML table markup ([Reference here](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp))
	* Bootstrap styles and style rules covered in the [ProPublica Data Style Guide](https://github.com/propublica/guides/blob/master/news-apps.md) reading and the [Remove to Improve Gifs](https://github.com/propublica/guides/blob/master/news-apps.md) (specifically, the table example).

Follow the commented instructions in `script.js`, `index.html` and `style.css`. You'll probably also want to refer to [the comments](https://github.com/chriscanipe/exercise-three/blob/master/js/script.js) I left in the execise-three repository.

* Commit it to your Git repo and send me the link via email.
* Due before class on Thursday March, 3.
